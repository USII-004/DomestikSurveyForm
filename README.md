This is a survey form for domestic application.
I want  to use javascript to validate user inputs as well as tell them to
input text on empty text fields.
Also be able to remove items from other sevices when the item option is selected in
most services section. 

this JS functionalities now work as expected however the if else statement involved are much there must be a way to rewrite the code and reduce the number of lines required to achieve the functions.
